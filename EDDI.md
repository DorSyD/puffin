# Edge-Driven Data Integration

Edge-Driven Data Integration (EDDI) is an inversion of control proposed by the PuffinDB project. Its main idea is that data integration should be driven at the edge by dynamic user-driven integration scenarios rather than on the cloud by static data integration pipelines, but without sacrificing proper architecture design and data governance.
