# Sponsors

The PuffinDB project is funded by [STOIC](https://stoic.com/).

## Sponsorship Opportunities
STOIC is currently discussing with several organizations (including competitors) that are interested in sponsoring this project. During its initial phases (most of 2023), this sponsorship will focus on the development of the [distributed query engine](docs/Query%20Engine.md) (most complex component). While a first release of PuffinDB should be made on the public repository (to be migrated to the [PuffinDB organization](https://github.com/PuffinDB)) sometime in Q2, the development of the distributed query engine will initially be done using a private repository, only accessible to sponsors. After its initial public release, further developments will take place on the public repository, while specific projects might still be initiated on private repositories. All projects will be released under MIT License eventually.
