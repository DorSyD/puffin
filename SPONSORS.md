# Sponsors

The PuffinDB project is currently funded by [STOIC](https://stoic.com/).

## Sponsorship Opportunities
STOIC is currently discussing with other organizations (including competitors) that are interested in sponsoring this project. During its initial phases (most of 2023), this sponsorship will focus on the development of the [distributed query engine](docs/Query%20Engine.md) (most complex component by far).
