# Sponsors

The PuffinDB project is currently funded by [STOIC](https://stoic.com/).

## Sponsorship Opportunities
STOIC is currently discussing with several organizations (including competitors) that are interested in sponsoring this project. During its initial phases (most of 2023), this sponsorship will focus on the development of the [distributed query engine](docs/Query%20Engine.md) (most complex component). While a first release of PuffinDB should be made on the public repository (to be migrated to the [PuffinDB organization](https://github.com/PuffinDB))
