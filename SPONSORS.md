# Sponsors

The PuffinDB project is funded by [STOIC](https://stoic.com/).

## Sponsorship Opportunities
STOIC is currently discussing with several organizations (including competitors) that are interested in sponsoring this project. During its initial phases (most of 2023), this sponsorship will focus on the development of the [distributed query engine](docs/Query%20Engine.md) (most complex component). While a first release of PuffinDB should be made on the public repository (to be migrated to the [PuffinDB organization](https://github.com/PuffinDB)) sometime in Q2, the development of the distributed query engine will initially be done using a private repository, only accessible to sponsors. After its initial public release, further developments will take place on the public repository, while specific projects might still be initiated on dedicated private repositories. Nevertheless, all such projects will be advertised ahead of time, thereby ensuring full transparency. Finally, all projects will be released under [MIT License](LICENSE.md) eventually.

## Benefits
Sponsors receive the following benefits:
- Immediate access to private repository with pull request privileges
- Participation in bi-weekly sprint meetings
- Voting rights regarding critical architecture decisions and [roadmap](ROADMAP.md) priorities
- Addition of test cases to automated testing framework
- Technical support
- Marketing exposure
- 100 karma points

## Offer
The first five sponsors will receive a 50% discount on their first-year membership. Please email info at stoic dot com for more information.

## Competitors
Competitors should consider sponsoring PuffinDB, for the following reasons:
- The project will happen (and succeed) with or without their support — *if you can't beat them, join them*.
- This kind of open source project will happen with or without PuffinDB — the market has a systemic need for something like it.
- Sponsorship will give competitors more visibility into what others are doing — good intelligence is priceless.
