# Query Planner

Multiple options have been considered for implementing the distributed query planner, including [Apache Calcite](https://calcite.apache.org/) and [DataFusion](https://github.com/apache/arrow-datafusion) (*C.f.* [#6](https://github.com/sutoiku/puffin/issues/7)). Apache Calcite has a very rich API and an established track record, but requires a JVM, which would make integration very challenging. DataFusion has been used successfully for projects like [`dask-sql`](https://github.com/dask-contrib/dask-sql), but would require migrating from [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), as well as integrating a secondary query engine, which would dramatically incraese the footprint of our [Engine](../functions/engine/README.md) serverless function.
