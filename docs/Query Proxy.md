PuffinDB is built upon the belief that [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) is [Cloud Data](../CLOUD.md)'s preferred language, and that countless SQL query generators like [Malloy](https://www.malloydata.dev/), [PRQL](https://prql-lang.org/), [Baxter](https://baxterhq.com/), or [WHERE TRUE](https://www.wheretrue.com/) will emerge over the coming years.
