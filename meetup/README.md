# Meetup

PuffinDB will hold a kickoff meeting for [sponsors](../SPONSORS.md) and committers in March 2023, at the [Grand Park Hotel](https://www.maistra.com/properties/grand-park-hotel-rovinj/#/) in Rovinj, Croatia. This event will take place over 3 days. Participants pay for travels expenses, while PuffinDB offers accomodations free of charge. The goal of the event is to finalize the architecture for PuffinDB, including [Icecap](../docs/Icecap.md). And to have some fun along the way...

This first gathering will set the benchmark for all future events — participants will receive a highly collectible *"I was there"* [lapel pin](https://worn-vintage.com/products/70s-david-lynch-eraserhead-i-saw-it-pin).

## Logistics
- Dates will be announced soon.
- Participants should fly through [Franjo Tuđman Airport Zagreb](https://www.zagreb-airport.hr/en). Or charter a sailboat for extra snobbery point.
- Roundtrip transportation between Zagreb and Rovinj will be organized by PuffinDB.

## Accomodations
The [Grand Park Hotel Rovinj](https://www.maistra.com/properties/grand-park-hotel-rovinj/#/) is... nice.

## Activities
PuffinDB will organize some activites, but participants will be free to spend their free time as they wish. This is **not** a bro party.

Good meals in Michelin starred restaurants will be served though.
