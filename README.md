# PuffinDB üêß
Serverless data lake [HTAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hybrid_transactional/analytical_processing) engine powered by [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) √ó [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) √ó [Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/)

PuffinDB is an initiative of [STOIC](https://stoic.com/), and not [DuckDB Labs](https://duckdblabs.com/) or the [DuckDB Foundation](https://duckdb.org/foundation/).

DuckDB and the DuckDB logo are trademarks of the DuckDB Foundation.

## Introduction
This is a proposal for an open source project [sponsored](SPONSORS.md) by [STOIC](https://stoic.com/). Its purpose is to make it easier to run [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) on serverless functions ([AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/), [Azure Function](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-overview), [Google Cloud Function](https://cloud.google.com/functions)) for executing read‚Äâ|‚Äâwrite queries against objects managed by an Object Store ([Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Azure Blob Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/storage/blobs), [Google Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage)) and tables managed by a Lakehouse ([Apache Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/), [Apache Hudi](https://hudi.apache.org/), [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/)).

If you are using DuckDB client-side with [any client application](docs/Clientless.md), adding PuffinDB will let you:
- Collaborate on the same [Iceberg tables](https://iceberg.apache.org/spec/) with other users
- Write back to an Iceberg table with [ACID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID) transactional integrity
- Handle datasets that are too large for your client
- Accelerate queries that run too slow on your client
- Integrate with external data sources (*Cf.* [Edge-Driven Data Integration](EDDI.md))
- Accelerate the downloading of large tables to your client
- Schedule fetching and client-side caching of [remote datasets](docs/Clientless.md#scheduled-remote-data-fetching-and-local-caching)
- Cache tables and run computations at the edge ([Amazon CloudFront](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/) √ó [Lambda@Edge](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/edge/))

All it takes is an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/) account and a few clicks on the [AWS Marketplace](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace) (PuffinDB is free and [runs on your VPC](FAQ.md#why-support-so-many-deployment-options)).

## Beliefs
- Nothing beats [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) because nothing can beat [maths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra)
- [Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) √ó [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/) √ó [Iceberg](https://iceberg.apache.org/) are game changers
- [Edge-Driven Data Integration](EDDI.md) is the way forward
- [Clientless](docs/Clientless.md) + [Serverless](docs/Architecture.md) = [Goodness](CLOUD.md)

## Philosophy
- **Developer-first** ‚Äî no non-sense, zero friction
- **Minimalist architecture** ‚Äî less dependencies is better
- **Lowest latency** ‚Äî every millisecond counts
- **Elastic design** ‚Äî from kilobytes to petabytes
- **Less is goodness** ‚Äî [serverless](docs/Architecture.md) &amp; [clientless](docs/Clientless.md)
